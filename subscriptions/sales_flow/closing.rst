Close your first subscription
=============================

Before closing a subscription, be sure to check out our documentation on how to
:doc:`Use subscription templates <../../subscriptions/configuration/subscription_templates>`,
:doc:`Create subscription products <../../subscriptions/configuration/subscription_products>` and,
how to
:doc:`Create a quotation <../../subscriptions/sales_flow/create_a_quotation>` using subscription
products.

Indeed, once confirmed, a quotation becomes a sales order and a new subscription is
automatically created. Therefore, this subscription has the status *In progress*. From there, you
have the possibility to renew the subscription. In the Other Info tab, underneath the To Renew
section, you can activate the *To renew* option. When activated, a yellow tag automatically appears
in the upper right corner of the subscription.
